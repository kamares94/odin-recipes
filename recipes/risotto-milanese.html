        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Making Italian risotto is a brief exercise in patience that yields a wonderfully creamy, comforting result. This version owes its delicate flavor and golden hue to saffron.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 1/2 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups arborio rice</li>
            <li>pinch of saffron threads</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>   
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a simmer; keep warm.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper, and cook over moderate heat, stirring, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook for 1 minute, stirring to thoroughly coat.</li>
            <li>Crumble the saffron into the wine and add it to the rice. Cook, stirring, until the wine is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Add 1 cup of the warm stock and cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, until nearly absorbed. Continue adding the stock 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until it is nearly absorbed between additions.</li>
            <li>The risotto is done when the rice is al dente and suspended in a thick, creamy sauce, about 20 minutes total. Season the risotto with salt and pepper. Stir in the cheese, butter, and parsley and serve immediately.</li>
